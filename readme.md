# Execution 

All code is written to be executed from the main directory. 

To start an experiment, simply execute 
```python main.py exp_name```

where ```exp_name``` is the name of an experiment configuration file in ```data/config/experiments``` without the file ending. 

For instance: ```python main.py exp_001```
